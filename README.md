## Synopsis
HabPi is a remote sensing package designed to be flown in high alititude
balloons.  The recommended hardware configuration is
  * A Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Stretch
  * A Sense HAT
  * 3 DS18B20 One-Wire Temperature Sensors
  * 4400mAh USB battery

Construction details will follow in a later version of this file.  For now, 
see my presentation at AHAC 2017 to get the gist of how this is assembled.
