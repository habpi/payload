## Synopsis
HabPi is a remote sensing package designed to be flown in high alititude
balloons.  The recommended hardware configuration is
  * A Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Stretch
  * A Sense HAT
  * 3 DS18B20 One-Wire Temperature Sensors
  * 4400mAh USB battery

Construction details will follow in a later version of this file.  For now, 
see my presentation at AHAC 2017 to get the gist of how this is assembled.

An academic paper will follow, which will be cited here.  For now, if you have
any questions, feel free to contact me and I will be glad to help!
